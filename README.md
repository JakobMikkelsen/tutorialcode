I have created this repo to share my code snippets from the blog. Currently the this repo contains code for:

  - Getting Started with Graph API
  - Projects created from the  [Lab](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-aspnetmvcapp/blob/master/Lab.md) at **Microsoft Graph**
  - [HOW TO - Secure your ReactJS frontend with Azure AD B2C](https://medium.com/@fiqriismail/how-to-secure-your-reactjs-frontend-with-azure-ad-b2c-8fd165f602e8)
